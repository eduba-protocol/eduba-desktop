Eduba is an open-source application for publishing articles peer-to-peer on the Holepunch platform. Eduba is also a protocol for publishing articles, so the community can build more clients. Wen mobile?

## How is Eduba like the web?

Articles in Eduba can link to other articles. Articles can contain images, audio, video, and more. Like the web, articles in Eduba can be an immersive experience. Link hopping can lead you to discover new authors and content. Like a blog platform, it is simple to create and publish new articles. You can subscribe to the publisher of content that you like. You can bookmark any article. You can organize bookmarks into folders.

In some web applications, you may have used the "share by link" feature, in which whoever has the link can access the content. Sharing Eduba articles works the same way. Whoever has an article link can view it. From an article, you can navigate to the publisher and see all of the publisher's articles.

## How is Eduba unlike the web?

Articles are published and transferred peer-to-peer. You own your data. You own it so much that if you do not leave Eduba running on your computer, your articles may not be served to the users who request them, depending on whether or not others are serving your articles. Over time, solutions will emerge so that you will be able to turn off your computer and your articles will still be available.

While the web allows you to publish articles independently, you must have a lot of know-how to do it, and you must make commitments to domain names, servers, etc. Eduba allows you to publish in the ultimate independent form, peer-to-peer, very easily, with no intermediaries.
